        <p>Welcome to Filthi Lounge, where every bite is made with love!</p>
        <p>
          We started with one simple mission â€” to serve delicious, comforting
          food that brings people together. Whether you are craving a cheesy
          pizza, a scoop of creamy ice cream, or a refreshing soft drink, we
          have got something for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team is passionate about great taste and good vibes. Every pizza
          is hand-tossed, every ice cream is served with a smile, and every
          drink is chilled to perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in using fresh ingredients, keeping things simple, and
          making every guest feel right at home.
        </p>
        <p>Come hungry, leave happy. That is our promise.</p>
